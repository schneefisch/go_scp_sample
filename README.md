GoLang Secure-Coding-Practices

This project orientates itself on the [OWASP Go-SCP Project](https://github.com/OWASP/Go-SCP).  
The intention is to provide some samples how secure coding practices can be implemented in a go project.

The main practices will be covered (hopefully soon) are

* (Input) Validation
  * User Interactivity
  * File Manipulation
  * Data sources
* Post-validation Actions
  * Enforcement Actions
* Sanitization
  * Invalid UTF-8
* URL request path
